1) NumberGuessingGame allows the user to play a game where you guess the number randomly selected based on a lower limit and an upper limit. It also checks if the user is correctly inputting an integer through a Try Except Else clause nested in a while loop.
2) WordGuessingGame allows the user to play a game where you guess a randomly selected word based on a list of pre existing words. The program will also print out the length of the word in dashes to give the user a hint of the length of the word. You can also guess the entire word at any point and the program will check if its correct. 
3) HangmanGame allows the user to play a word guessing game.
