1) NumberGuessingGame allows the user to play a game where you guess the number randomly selected based on a lower limit and an upper limit. It also checks if the user is correctly inputting an integer through a Try Except Else clause nested in a while loop.
2) WordGuessingGame allows the user to play a game where you guess a randomly selected word based ona list of pre existing words. The program will also print out the length of the word in dashes to give the user a hint of the length of the word.

Python notes
Getting started
â€¢	Can check the python version by importing the sys module
  o	import sys
  o	print(sys.version)
    can type "python" on cmd to start writing code on the cmd itsself.
    to exit type "exit()"

Python Syntax
  in cmd "python filename.py" to run a python file.
  Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Comments
  used to explain the code.
  can be used to make the code more readable.
  can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
  triple single quotes are multi line comments as long as they are not assigned to a variable.
  
Python Variables
  Python has no command for decalring a variable. Variables are created when you assign a value to it.
  Variables are containers for storing data values.

  Casting
  If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done using casting.
  ex: x = str(3)    y = int(3)    z = float(3)
  Type fucntion
  You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function
  ex:  print(type(x))
  Variable names are case-sensitive
